# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tiago Azevedo.

#### I am a research physicist, holding a bachelor's degree from the Federal University of ViÃ§osa, and currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the same university in the field of Statistical and Computational Physics. I have experience in mathematical and computational modeling of stochastic processes, including data analysis, visualization, and manipulation. I am seeking a position in the job market as a data analyst, where I can apply the skills I have acquired during my education, along with the recent self-learning I have undertaken, to help companies optimize their results through data analysis.
* ðŸ“Š In data_analysis_portfolio, you can find my portfolio of data analysis projects. Here, I use Python and Power BI for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
* ðŸ¤– In machine_learning_projects, you can find a rental price prediction model using machine learning and a survey on ML techniques applied in my current research area.
* ðŸ“‘ I have two articles published in international journals in the field of statistical and computational physics, which can be accessed [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1483/1/012001) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2022.127909).
* ðŸ“« You can reach me at [tiago.phys@gmail.com](mailto:tiago.phys@gmail.com) or through my LinkedIn profile at www.linkedin.com/in/tnazevedo/.
